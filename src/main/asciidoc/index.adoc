= RabbitMQ Client for Vert.x

A Vert.x client allowing applications to interact with a RabbitMQ broker (AMQP 0.9.1)

**This service is experimental and the APIs are likely to change before settling down.**

== Getting Started

=== Maven

Add the following dependency to your maven project

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-rabbitmq-client</artifactId>
  <version>${maven.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Gradle

Add the following dependency to your gradle project

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
dependencies {
  compile 'io.vertx:vertx-rabbitmq-client:${maven.version}'
}
----

=== Create a client

You can create a client instance as follows using a full amqp uri:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#createClientWithUri}
----

Or you can also specify individual parameters manually:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#createClientWithManualParams}
----

You can set multiples addresses to connect to a cluster;

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#createClientWithMultipleHost}
----

Reconnections

The RabbitMQClient will, by default, retry connecting to the RabbitMQ server if it cannot connect.
It will also attempt to reconnect whenever the connection to the RabbitMQ server becomes broken.
The failure of a connection could be caused by a transient network failure (where the client would probably connect back to the same RabbitMQ server) or it could be caused by a failover scenario.

The reconnection policy can be configured by setting the {@link io.vertx.core.net.NetClientOptions#setReconnectInterval(long)} and
{@link io.vertx.core.net.NetClientOptions#setReconnectAttempts(int)} properties in the configuration:
[source, java]
----
RabbitMQOptions config = new RabbitMQOptions();
options.setReconnectAttempts(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
options.setReconnectInterval(500);
----

As soon as the connection has been re-established users of the client may attempt to publish (or consume) messages.
However, if the connection is to a new RabbitMQ server it is possible that objects created through this RabbitMQClient won't exist,. i.e. when exchanges and queues are created through the RabbitMQClient on startup.
To provide an opportunity to create these objects before the connection is considered ready the RabbitMQClient provides the ConnectionEstablishedCallback.
The ConnectionEstablishedCallback can be used to carry out any operations on the RabbitMQClient before other users (including the RabbitMQConsumer and RabbitMQPublisher) are able to access it.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#connectionEstablishedCallback}
----

If a RabbitMQConsumer is listening for messages on an auto-delete server-named queue and the broker restarts the queue will have been removed by the time the client reconnects.
In this instance it is necessary to both recreate the queue and set the new queue name on the RabbitMQConsumer.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#connectionEstablishedCallbackForServerNamedAutoDeleteQueue}
----

==== Enabling SSL/TLS on the client

The RabbitMQClient can easily configured to use SSL. 
[source,$lang]
----
RabbitMQOptions options = new RabbitMQOptions()
  .setSsl(true);
----

===== Client trust configuration

If {@link io.vertx.core.net.ClientOptionsBase#setTrustAll trustAll} is set to true, the client will trust all server certificates. 
The connection will still be encrypted but is then vulnerable to 'man in the middle' attacks.
*Greatbadness*, Do not use this option in production! Default value is false.

[source,$lang]
----
RabbitMQOptions options = new RabbitMQOptions()
  .setSsl(true)
  .setTrustAll(true));
----

If {@link io.vertx.core.net.ClientOptionsBase#setTrustAll trustAll} is set to false, proper server authentication will takes place. Three main options are available. 

 - Your default truststore already "trusts" the server, in which case all is fine +
 - You start the java process with -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=xxx.jks specifying the custom trust store +
 - You supply a custom trust store via RabbitMQOptions

===== JKS trust store option
[source,$lang]
----
RabbitMQOptions options = new RabbitMQOptions()
  .setSsl(true)
  .setTrustOptions(new JksOptions()
    .setPath("/path/myKeyStore.jks")
    .setPassword("myKeyStorePassword"));
----
===== p12/pfx trust store option
[source,$lang]
----
RabbitMQOptions options = new RabbitMQOptions()
  .setSsl(true)
  .setPfxTrustOptions(
    new PfxOptions().
      setPath("/path/myKeyStore.p12").
      setPassword("myKeyStorePassword"));
----
===== PEM trust option
[source,$lang]
----
RabbitMQOptions options = new RabbitMQOptions()
  .setSsl(true)
  .setPemTrustOptions(
    new PemTrustOptions().
      addCertPath("/path/ca-cert.pem"));
----


=== Declare exchange with additional config

You can pass additional config parameters to RabbitMQ's exchangeDeclare method

[source, $lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#exchangeDeclareWithConfig(io.vertx.rabbitmq.RabbitMQClient)}
----

=== Declare queue with additional config

You can pass additional config parameters to RabbitMQs queueDeclare method

[source, $lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#queueDeclareWithConfig(io.vertx.rabbitmq.RabbitMQClient)}
----

== Operations

The following are some examples of the operations supported by the RabbitMQService API.
Consult the javadoc/documentation for detailed information on all API methods.

=== Publish

Publish a message to a queue

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#basicPublish}
----

=== Publish with confirm

Publish a message to a queue and confirm the broker acknowledged it.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#basicPublishWithConfirm}
----

=== Reliable Message Publishing

In order to reliably publish messages to RabbitMQ it is necessary to handle confirmations that each message has been accepted by the server.
The simplest approach to confirmations is to use the basicPublishWithConfirm approach, above, which synchronously confirms each message when it is sent - blocking the publishing channel until the confirmation is received.

In order to achieve greater throughput RabbitMQ provides asynchronous confirmations.
The asynchronous confirmations can confirm multiple messages in one go, so it is necessary for the client to track all messages in the order that they were published.
Also, until messages are confirmed by the server it may be necessary to resend them, so they must be retained by the client.

The RabbitMQPublisher class implements a standard approach to handling asynchronous confirmations, avoiding much of the boiler plate code that would otherwise be required.

The RabbitMQPublisher works by:
* Adding all sent messages to an internal queue.
* Sending messages from the queue when it is able, keeping track of these messages pending acknowledgement in a separate queue.
* Handling asynchronous confirmations from RabbitMQ, removing messages from the pendingAck queue once they are confirmed.
* Notifying the caller for each message that is confirmed (this is always a single message at a time, not the bulk confirmation used by RabbitMQ).

Delivery Tags

This section is an implementation detail that is useful for anyone that wants to implement their own alternative to RabbitMQPublisher.

For the RabbitMQPublisher to work it has to know the delivery tag that RabbitMQ will use for each message published.
The confirmations from RabbitMQ can arrive at the client before the call to basicPublish has completed, so it is not possible to identify the delivery tag via anything returned by basicPublish if asynchronous confirmations are being used.
For this reason it is necessary for the RabbitMQClient to tell the RabbitMQPublisher the delivery tag of each message via a separate callback that occurs in the call to RabbitMQClient::basicPublish before the message is actually sent on the network.
It is also possible for the delivery tag of a single message to change (delivery tags are per-channel, so if the message is resent following a reconnection it will have a new delivery tag) - this means that we cannot use a Future to inform the client of the delivery tag.
If the deliveryTagHandler is called more than once for a given message it is always safe to ignore the previous value - there can be only one valid delivery tag for a message at any time.

To capture the delivery tag one of the RabbitMqClient::basicPublishWithDeliveryTag methods should be used.
[source, java]
----
  void basicPublishWithDeliveryTag(String exchange, String routingKey, BasicProperties properties, Buffer body, Handler<Long> deliveryTagHandler, Handler<AsyncResult<Void>> resultHandler);
  Future<Void> basicPublishWithDeliveryTag(String exchange, String routingKey, BasicProperties properties, Buffer body, @Nullable Handler<Long> deliveryTagHandler);
----
These methods 

=== Consume

Consume messages from a queue.

[source,$lang]
----
// Create a stream of messages from a queue
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#basicConsumer}
----

At any moment of time you can pause or resume the stream. When stream is paused you won't receive any message.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#pauseAndResumeConsumer(io.vertx.rabbitmq.RabbitMQConsumer)}
----

There are actually a set of options to specify when creating a consumption stream.

The `QueueOptions` lets you specify:

 * The size of internal queue with `setMaxInternalQueueSize`
 * Should the stream keep more recent messages when queue size is exceed with `setKeepMostRecent`

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#basicConsumerOptions}
----

When you want to stop consuming message from a queue, you can do:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#cancelConsumer}
----

You can get notified by the end handler when the queue won't process any more messages:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#endHandlerConsumer}
----

You can set the exception handler to be notified of any error that may occur when a message is processed:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#exceptionHandler}
----

And finally, you may want to retrive a related to the consumer tag:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#consumerTag}
----

=== Get

Will get a message from a queue

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#getMessage}
----

=== Consume messages without auto-ack

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.RabbitMQExamples#consumeWithManualAck}
----



== Running the tests

You will need to have RabbitMQ installed and running with default ports on localhost for this to work.
